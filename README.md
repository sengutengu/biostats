# Biostatistics
BIOL2300, Jeffrey DaCosta, Summer 2024, Boston College

## About
I took biostatistics this summer and really enjoyed it. I had taken three (!) statistics classes, two of them
graduate, through the Department of Psychology & Neuroscience before this one. Some things just take a long 
time to click and statistics has definitely been one of them for me. Maybe it's because I find biological
data simply more interesting, but on my fourth try, I actually came to understand statistics at a more 
intuitive level than before. 

Here's the course description:

>This course will introduce biology students to the basic statistical techniques that are used in conducting
biological and medical research. The course is divided into four parts: (1) descriptive statistics (averages,
variability); (2) probability and probability distributions (basic probability theory and the binomial,
Poisson, and normal distributions); (3) statistical inference (parametric and non-parametric tests); and (4)
relationships between variables (correlation and linear regression). Students will become familiar with a
standard statistical analysis software package and will critique actual research papers.

All standard stuff, but the emphasis on analyzing actual data using R has been really fun. I think application
is what finally helped me make better sense of statistics.

We used Whitlock & Schluter's *Analysis of Biology Data*, 3rd edition. It's really well-written. I used the 
2nd edition with no issues.

In this repository, you'll find the R files I used and wrote for this course, along with the data files.
